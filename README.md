Earthquake Visualization



I created a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from my data set based on their longitude and latitude.



The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, and i utilized the JSON format.



The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color.


Popups provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.



The legend provides context for the map data.
